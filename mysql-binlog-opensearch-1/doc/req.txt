ðŸ§  Prompt: CDK Deployment Template for Real-Time MySQL Binlog to OpenSearch on AWS

Design an AWS infrastructure using AWS CDK that:
	1.	Uses Amazon RDS (MySQL) as the database.
	â€¢	Binary logging enabled to support Change Data Capture (CDC).
	â€¢	The RDS instance must be publicly accessible.
	2.	Uses Amazon ECS Fargate to run a Debezium connector container.
	â€¢	The connector reads MySQL binlog events and pushes them to Kinesis.
	â€¢	ECS service should be deployed in private subnets with NAT access.
	â€¢	Secrets like DB credentials should be stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
	3.	Uses Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest binlog events from Debezium.
	4.	(Optional but recommended) Use Amazon Kinesis Firehose to deliver Kinesis stream data to Amazon OpenSearch Service.
	â€¢	Enable basic transformation support using AWS Lambda if needed.
	5.	Deploy an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain.
	â€¢	Configure index mappings and make it accessible for querying from AWS services.
	6.	Set up:
	â€¢	A VPC with both public and private subnets.
	â€¢	Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway(s).
	â€¢	Required IAM roles for ECS tasks and Lambda.
	â€¢	CloudWatch log groups for ECS and Lambda.
	â€¢	Security groups to allow MySQL access from ECS and public access to MySQL for external connections.
