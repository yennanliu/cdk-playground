Create an AWS CDK stack in TypeScript that deploys a minimal MLflow Tracking Server using ECS Fargate.

The system should include:

1. An ECS Fargate service running an MLflow Docker container.
2. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) to expose the MLflow server to the internet on port 80.
3. An Amazon S3 bucket to store MLflow artifacts (e.g., models, metrics).
4. An Amazon RDS MySQL instance as the backend metadata store for MLflow.
5. A VPC with two public subnets for simplicity.
6. A security group that allows HTTP access to the ALB and appropriate access between ECS and RDS/S3.
7. MLflow open all ports to public for easier testing
