üßë‚Äçüíª Prompt:

You are a Senior AWS CDK expert (TypeScript) helping me build a minimal proof-of-concept AWS infrastructure. I want you to help me create CDK code (in TypeScript) for the following:
	1.	A public PostgreSQL database (Amazon RDS), accessible to all IPs (0.0.0.0/0), with:
	‚Ä¢	Username: postgre
	‚Ä¢	Password: postgre
	‚Ä¢	Minimal configuration for testing only (single AZ, default VPC, no encryption, no backups)
	2.	A public Redis instance (Amazon ElastiCache for Redis), with:
	‚Ä¢	No password (open access for testing)
	‚Ä¢	Allow all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0
	3.	An Amazon ECR repository for hosting Docker images

Constraints:
	‚Ä¢	Keep the CDK project structure and configuration as minimal as possible.
	‚Ä¢	Use TypeScript.
	‚Ä¢	No advanced networking (no private subnets, no VPC peering, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	This is just a test/prototype ‚Äî security is NOT a concern for now.
