Create an AWS CDK stack in TypeScript to implement a minimal system for Change Data Capture (CDC) from a MySQL database to Amazon S3 using AWS DMS.

The stack should include:

1. A MySQL-compatible Amazon RDS instance (or use an existing external MySQL source if you prefer).
2. An S3 bucket to store the output CDC files in JSON format.
3. An IAM role that allows AWS DMS to write to the S3 bucket.
4. A DMS replication instance (e.g., dms.t3.micro).
5. A DMS source endpoint pointing to the MySQL RDS.
6. A DMS target endpoint pointing to the S3 bucket.
7. A DMS replication task with the following settings:
   - Migration type: Full load + CDC
   - Output format: JSON
   - Folder in S3: `cdc/`
8. Mysql open to public, so I can test send data to it

Assume the MySQL RDS instance has binary logging enabled (binlog_format = ROW), and that DMS user has necessary permissions (REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT).

Keep the CDK stack as simple and modular as possible. Use appropriate removal policies for development and testing.

Output the complete CDK code in a single TypeScript file.
