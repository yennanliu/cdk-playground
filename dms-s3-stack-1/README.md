# MySQL - DMS - S3 Stack -1 

🧱 System Design: MySQL to S3 via AWS DMS (CDC)

🎯 Goal:

Continuously replicate changes (CDC) from a MySQL database to Amazon S3, using AWS DMS for minimal infrastructure and setup.

⚙️ Components

Component	Description
MySQL DB	The source database; can be an RDS MySQL or EC2-hosted MySQL instance.
AWS DMS	AWS Data Migration Service — handles data capture and replication.
DMS Source Endpoint	Configured to connect to the MySQL database (CDC enabled).
DMS Target Endpoint	Configured to write data into an S3 bucket.
S3 Bucket	Stores CDC records as JSON or CSV files in s3://<bucket>/cdc/.


⸻

✅ Step-by-Step Setup
	1.	Enable Binary Logging in MySQL
	•	Set binlog_format = ROW
	•	Enable log_bin and set server_id
	•	Grant DMS access:

GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'dms_user'@'%';


	2.	Create an S3 Bucket
	•	Name: my-cdc-bucket
	•	Enable server-side encryption (optional)
	3.	Set up IAM Role for DMS to access S3
	•	Create an IAM role with access to write to your S3 bucket
	•	Attach the role to DMS
	4.	Configure DMS
	•	Source endpoint: MySQL with CDC enabled
	•	Target endpoint: Amazon S3
	•	Replication instance: Choose a small size for testing (e.g., dms.t3.micro)
	•	Replication task:
	•	Migration type: “CDC only” or “Full load + CDC”
	•	Output format: JSON (default) or CSV
	•	Target folder: cdc/ inside your S3 bucket

📦 Example Folder Structure in S3

s3://my-cdc-bucket/cdc/
  └── database_name/
      └── table_name/
          ├── LOAD0001.json
          ├── CDC0001.json
          └── CDC0002.json


⸻

💡 Benefits
	•	✅ Serverless, fully managed
	•	📤 Real-time data updates with minimal setup
	•	💾 Files in S3 can be used for backup, analysis, or downstream ETL

⸻

🛡️ Optional Enhancements

Feature	Service
Real-time event parsing	AWS Lambda on S3 event
Searchable data	Load into OpenSearch or Athena
Glue Catalog integration	AWS Glue Crawler
Long-term archiving	S3 Lifecycle Policy
