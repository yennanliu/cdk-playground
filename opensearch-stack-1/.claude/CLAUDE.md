Help me implement the necessary AWS CDK code for Amazon OpenSearch Service.

Refer to this repo:
https://github.com/yennanliu/cdk-playground/tree/main/amazon-opensearch-service-sample-cdk-2

Instructions:
	•	Only copy the relevant CDK implementation code.
	•	Do not include scripts, documentation, config files, or anything unrelated to core infrastructure.
	•	Keep the code minimal and aligned with the core use case (i.e., setting up OpenSearch, firehose, lambda...).
	•	Output should be clean CDK code (in TypeScript), suitable for use in an existing CDK app.
	•	Assume the rest of the CDK stack (e.g. app.ts, basic CDK project setup) is already in place.

NOTE:
	- DON'T save compile js, d.ts files in @lib path, since we don't need those code. CDK will take care when deploy
