# EKS Infra - EKS App

Yes, it's absolutely **possible** and, in many larger or more complex organizations, it's a common and recommended architectural pattern.

This strategy is known as **separation of concerns** and often employs a **Hub-and-Spoke** or **Dedicated Cluster** model.

***

## üí° The Architectural Idea

The core idea is to separate your workloads based on their **stability, operational needs, and cost model**:

| Cluster | Purpose/Workload | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EKS-1 (Infra Cluster)** | **Stateful Services:** Kafka, Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB), Service Mesh Control Plane, Service Registry (e.g., Consul, Eureka). | **Highly Stable**, less frequently updated, requires dedicated storage (EBS/EFS), often uses larger or specialized nodes (e.g., memory-optimized). |
| **EKS-2 (App Cluster)** | **Stateless Services:** Web/API applications, microservices, batch jobs, CI/CD runners. | **Highly Dynamic**, frequent deployments/updates, scaling events, requires robust networking, often uses smaller or Spot instances for cost savings. |

## ü§ù How Applications Connect

The main challenge (and the solution) lies in enabling cross-cluster communication:

1.  **VPC Peering or Transit Gateway:**
    * Both EKS clusters (and their underlying EC2 worker nodes) reside in separate AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).
    * You must establish **VPC Peering** or use a **Transit Gateway** to create a direct, private, and secure network connection between the VPCs of EKS-1 and EKS-2. This makes the IP addresses of the services in EKS-1 reachable from EKS-2.

2.  **Service Discovery (Internal DNS/Load Balancers):**
    * The services in EKS-1 (like Kafka and DB) must expose themselves securely. This is typically done using **Internal Network Load Balancers (NLBs)** or by relying on **ClusterIP/Headless Services** within EKS-1 and configuring DNS resolution (e.g., using AWS Route 53 private hosted zones) so that EKS-2 can resolve the stable internal endpoints of the infrastructure.

3.  **Security Groups:**
    * The Security Groups for the EKS-1 worker nodes must be configured to **allow inbound traffic** for the necessary ports (e.g., 5432 for Postgres, 9092 for Kafka) *only* from the Security Group(s) associated with the EKS-2 worker nodes. This ensures the connection is private and secure.
