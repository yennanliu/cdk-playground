Great task! You want your Airflow ECS Fargate service to **load DAG files from local source files on your CDK machine** (via `dags` folder) so Airflow can see those DAGs at runtime.

---

### Key challenge

* ECS Fargate containers are **ephemeral** — they don't have persistent local storage accessible from your laptop.
* You cannot mount local folders directly into Fargate containers like on your dev machine.
* Instead, you need to **inject your local DAG files into the container at runtime** or make them accessible inside the container.

---

### Common approaches to get local DAGs into Airflow container on ECS Fargate

1. **Use CDK Asset (S3) + bind mount as a volume**

   * CDK uploads your `dags/` folder to an S3 bucket as an asset.
   * ECS task can access that S3 asset (via IAM permissions).
   * You can mount the S3 asset via a volume or download the files inside the container.

   *BUT:* Fargate tasks cannot directly mount S3 as a volume.

2. **Use ECS task container volume + container mount + init container or entrypoint script**

   * Define an **empty volume** in task definition.
   * Use an **init container or entrypoint** to copy DAG files from somewhere (e.g., S3 or a container image) into the volume before starting Airflow.
   * The main Airflow container mounts the volume as `/opt/airflow/dags`.

3. **Bake DAGs into a custom Docker image**

   * Build a Docker image based on `apache/airflow` but including your DAGs copied in the image `/opt/airflow/dags`.
   * Push image to ECR.
   * ECS runs that image.

---

### Your current code is almost there but:

* You're creating a CDK Asset for your local `dags` folder, which gets uploaded to an S3 bucket.
* You're adding a volume with `host.sourcePath: /opt/airflow/dags` — but in **Fargate**, `host.sourcePath` is **NOT supported**. (Only valid for EC2 launch type).

---

### So **how to fix your CDK to make ECS Fargate Airflow load DAGs from your local?**

---

## Recommended approach: Use S3 + init container (or entrypoint script)

1. **Keep the CDK asset for your DAGs (already done).**

2. **Add permissions to the task role to read the S3 asset bucket (already partially done).**

3. **Modify your Airflow container startup to:**

   * At container start, download DAG files from the S3 asset bucket (which contains your `dags`).
   * Copy them into `/opt/airflow/dags`.

---

### How to implement this practically?

* In your container definition, override the entrypoint or CMD to run a shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
aws s3 cp s3://<your-asset-bucket>/<your-dags-key> /opt/airflow/dags --recursive
exec airflow webserver
```

Or you can write a tiny init script to sync DAGs from S3 before launching Airflow.

---

### Step-by-step to update your CDK

1. **Grant read access to S3 bucket containing the asset DAGs** (already granted to `executionRole`, but Airflow container runs as `taskRole` — make sure it has read permission).

2. **Add environment variables for the bucket/key prefix** to your container.

3. **Override the container command or entrypoint** to:

* Download the DAGs from S3 into `/opt/airflow/dags`
* Start the Airflow webserver (or scheduler as appropriate)

4. **Remove the `host.sourcePath` volume** (not supported on Fargate).

5. **Use an empty volume (docker volume)** mounted at `/opt/airflow/dags` if you want a writable mount, or just use the container filesystem.

---

### Questions for you before coding:

* Do you want to run Airflow scheduler + webserver in the same task or separate tasks?
* Should DAGs be updated automatically when you deploy CDK (yes, the asset upload triggers this)?
* Do you want to keep your current image (`apache/airflow:2.8.1`), or do you want me to help you build a custom Docker image with DAGs baked in (simpler for runtime but less flexible)?

Once you confirm your preference, I can help you draft the CDK update code accordingly.
